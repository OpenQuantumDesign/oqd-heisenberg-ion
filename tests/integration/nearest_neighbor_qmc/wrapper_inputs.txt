# All input parameters relevant for the SSE program are provided in this file in a tab-delimited format.
# Each input field can be specified by a list of values or a single value. 
# If a list is provided for any system or simulation parameter, as many runs as the length of the list will be started. 
# If a single value is provided for any parameter, that value will be assumed to be constant across the list of requested simulations. 
# If any two lists have different lengths, the SSE program will error out. 

simulator	nearest_neighbor_qmc
hamiltonian_name	XY	# Can be XY (J=-1, Delta=0), FMHeisenbergFMZ (J=-1, Delta=1), FMHeisenbergAFMZ (J=-1, Delta=-1), AFMHeisenbergFMZ (J=1, Delta=1), XXZ or XXZh
boundary	periodic	# Open or Periodic
interaction_range	long_range	# Long Range or Nearest Neighbours
interaction_type	power_law	# Power-Law or Input-Matrix
spatial_dimension	1d	# Only 1d is currently supported. The other option is 2d (for 2d triangular lattices) - still in testing
lattice_type	rectangular	# Only 'Rectangular' is currently supported. The other type is 'Triangular' - still in testing

# System Parameters
N	3	# Number of sites - any positive integer
Delta	0.0	# Anisotropy strength (coefficient of the Z_i Z_j term in the Hamiltonian). Can be any real number
h	0.0	# External field in the z direction - any real number
alpha	1.0	# Power law interaction strength exponent (alpha in 1/r^{alpha}). Can be any positive real number
J	1.0	# Energy scale - any positive real number
T	0.005	# Temperature - any positive real number

# Simulation Parameters
equilibration_steps	1000	# Number of steps used for equilibration. Can be any positive integer
simulation_steps	1000	# Number of Monte Carlo steps used for computing observables after equilibration. Can be any positive integer 
operator_list_update_multiplier	1.01	# Operator list size growth proportion after each equilibration step. Can be any real number greater than 1

# SSE Loop Parameters
loop_type	deterministic	# Can be 'deterministic', 'directed_loops' or 'heat_bath' depending on the type of the loops. The 'determininistic' loop type only applies to the XY and the Heisenberg models
gamma	0.0	# Directed loop probability table parameter.
ksi	0.0	# directed_loop probability table parameter.
distance_dependent_offset	False	# bool - Directed loop probability table parameter.

number_of_threads	-1	# Number of CPU threads to use. This parameter is optional. Setting it to 1 uses a single thread all simulations are executed serially. Setting it to a positive integers will divide 
track_spin_configurations	False	# bool - Determines whether shot data collected across Monte Carlo steps. 
write_final_spin_configuration	False	# bool - Determines whether final SSE configurations need to be written to a file

# Initial Configuration Parameters
initial_configuration_index	0	# 1 or -1 starts the simulation with all spins up or down respectively. 0 picks each spin randomly. -2 uses the configuration provided. Positive integers k > 1 correspond to lattice site i starting with spin up if i mod k = 0
initial_configuration_file_path	None	# Only used if Initial Configuration Index = -2
initial_operator_list_size	-1	# Can be set to any integer. Set it to -1 to use default values. Not used if Initial Configuration index is -2.
